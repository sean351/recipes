These soft pretzel bites are exactly like regular homemade soft pretzels, but shaped into smaller pieces. The dough requires just 6 ingredients and there's hardly any rise time, so this is a wonderful recipe for yeast beginners. Have fun shaping the bites (they don't need to be perfect!) and enjoy warm flavorful homemade pretzels within an hour.

## Instructions

### 1. Make the Dough

Whisk warm water, yeast, and sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a paddle or dough hook attachment. (If you do not have a stand mixer, just use a regular large mixing bowl and a wooden spoon or silicone spatula.) Cover yeast mixture and allow to sit for 5 minutes or until foamy on top.

Add salt, melted butter, and 3 cups (375g) of flour. Beat on low speed for 1 minute, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula if needed, then add ¾ cup (95g) of flour. Beat on low speed until the dough comes together and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 2 minutes.

If dough is extremely sticky after 1 minute of mixing, add remaining ¼ cup of flour and continue to beat for 1 more minute.

### 2. Knead the Dough

Keep the dough in the mixer (and switch to the dough hook if using the paddle) and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes.

If the dough becomes too sticky during the kneading process, sprinkle 1 teaspoon of flour at a time on the dough or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough.

After kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise.

Cover lightly with a towel and allow to rest for 10-30 minutes.

### 3. Prepare Oven and Baking Sheets

Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Silicone baking mats are highly recommended over parchment paper. If using parchment paper, lightly spray with nonstick spray or grease with butter.

### 4. Shape the Pretzel Bites

With a sharp knife, pizza cutter, or bench scraper, cut dough into 6 equal pieces (just eyeball it, doesn't have to be perfect).

Sprinkle work surface very lightly with flour. Roll each piece of dough into a 20-inch rope. If the ropes keep shrinking and stretching the dough becomes difficult, stop what you're doing, lightly cover all of the dough, and let it rest for 10 minutes so the gluten can relax. Then, return to rolling it into ropes.

Cut each rope into 1.5–2 inch pieces to make bites.

### 5. Baking Soda Bath

Mix water and baking soda together in a large pot. Bring to a boil.

Place 8-10 pretzel bites into the boiling water for a quick 10-15 seconds. (Any longer and your pretzels could take on a metallic taste.)

Using a slotted spatula or spoon, lift the pretzel bites out of the water and allow as much of the excess water to drip off.

Place bites onto prepared baking sheets. Sprinkle each with coarse sea salt while they are still wet or leave plain if using cinnamon sugar topping.

Repeat baking soda bath with remaining pretzel bites.

### 6. Bake

Bake for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve warm.

## Recipe Notes

### Cinnamon Sugar Version

Bake the pretzel bites completely plain without salt. As the pretzel bites bake, melt 4 Tablespoons (60g) unsalted butter. Set aside. Combine ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar and 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon. Set aside.

Once the pretzels are done and still warm out of the oven, brush each with melted butter then generously dip into cinnamon sugar.

**Note:** Cinnamon sugar pretzels are best served that day because the melted butter topping causes them to become soggy after a few hours.

### Storage

Cover and store leftover pretzel bites at room temperature for up to 3 days. They lose a little softness over time. To reheat, microwave for a few seconds or bake in a 350°F (177°C) for 5 minutes.

### Make-Ahead Tips

If you won't be serving the pretzel bites the same day you bake them, omit the salt-topping step. Bake as directed, then allow to cool completely before placing them in an airtight container, and store at room temperature. When you are ready to serve them, place the pretzel bites on a baking sheet and brush them lightly with water, then sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake them in a 350°F (177°C) oven for 5 minutes, or until warmed through.

### Freezing Instructions

Cool the unsalted baked pretzel bites completely, then freeze in an airtight freezer-safe container or zip-top bag for up to 3 months. To reheat, brush frozen pretzel bites (no need to thaw) with water and sprinkle with coarse salt, then bake at 350°F (177°C) for 10 minutes or until warmed through.

The prepared pretzel dough can be covered and refrigerated for up to one day or frozen in an airtight container for 2–3 months. Thaw frozen dough in the refrigerator overnight. Refrigerated dough can be shaped into pretzel bites while still cold, but allow some extra time, about 1 hour, for the pretzel bites to puff up before continuing with the baking soda bath and baking.

## Tips for Success

- **Flour:** If you have it, the same amount of bread flour works instead of all-purpose flour. Do not use whole wheat flour.

- **The heavier you flour the work surface, the harder it is to roll the dough.** A little stickiness actually helps. You only need a very light dusting of flour.

- **Baking soda bath:** This is the key step that provides the iconic chewy pretzel texture and adds a deeper, richer color to the baked pretzels. The boiling water also locks in the shape so the pretzels don't over-puff in the oven.

- **Toppings:** Try everything bagel seasoning instead of coarse salt. Heavily sprinkle on the pretzels while they're still wet from the baking soda bath before baking.
