Make homemade cheese crackers with only 6 ingredients! These crisp crackers are a simple take-anywhere snack and have the most unbelievable salty, cheesy flavor. Chilling the dough for 45 minutes is important—the crackers won't hold their shape otherwise. You'll appreciate the straightforward instructions and quick baking time!

## Ingredients

- 6 ounces sharp yellow cheddar cheese, shredded (1½ cups shredded)
- 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
- 1½ teaspoons cornstarch
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cold and cut into 6 pieces
- 2 Tablespoons cold water
- **Optional:** sea salt for sprinkling

## Instructions

### 1. Make the Dough

Process cheddar cheese, flour, cornstarch, and salt together in a food processor until combined, about 30 seconds.

Add butter and process until mixture resembles wet sand, about 20 seconds.

Add water and pulse until dough forms large clumps, about 10 pulses.

### 2. Chill the Dough

Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide in half and pat each into a 6-inch square. (No need to use a rolling pin, just pat with hands.)

If the dough feels dry, moisten your fingers with cold water.

Carefully wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes and up to 2 days.

### 3. Preheat and Prepare

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

### 4. Roll and Cut

Unwrap each dough square. Place each on a lightly floured work surface and roll out into a 9-inch square. Doesn't need to be perfect!

Using a fluted pastry wheel, pizza cutter, or small sharp knife, trim dough into a neat 8-inch square.

Slice square into 8 strips, each 1 inch wide, then make 8 perpendicular slices, each 1 inch wide. Each 8-inch square will have 64 squares (crackers).

### 5. Add Details and Bake

Place squares on prepared baking sheet. Use a skewer or large toothpick to poke a hole through the center of each.

Lightly sprinkle with sea salt, if desired.

Bake until golden brown around the edges, about 16-18 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through baking. For crunchier crackers, bake for 20 minutes.

### 6. Cool and Serve

Remove from the oven and cool completely on the baking sheet before serving.

## Recipe Notes

### Cheese Options

- **Best choice:** Use a block of real cheddar cheese that you freshly grate at home since it has more flavor than pre-shredded cheeses.
- **Recommended:** Sharp yellow cheddar, but you can use mild or white cheddar cheese.
- **Other options:** Instead of classic yellow cheddar, white cheddar is a wonderful substitute. In fact, any medium-hard cheese is great. Avoid soft cheeses.

### Cornstarch Note

The original recipe (which is half of this one) calls for 1 teaspoon of cornstarch, but 2 teaspoons made the crackers too soft. This recipe uses 1½ teaspoons for the perfect texture.

### Crunchy vs. Soft

- **For softer crackers:** Bake for about 16 minutes
- **For crunchier crackers:** Bake for 19-20 minutes

### Storage

Store leftover crackers at room temperature for up to 1 week. If tightly sealed, they'll lose their crunch. Feel free to keep the lid slightly ajar to maintain some crunchiness.

Keep in mind that since there's no added preservatives, the crackers will soften up after a couple days.

### Freezing Instructions

You can freeze the wrapped dough instead of refrigerating it in step 2. Freeze up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature for 10 minutes before continuing with the recipe.

## Tips for Success

- **Food processor is key:** This recipe requires a food processor. A blender may work as an alternative, or you can use a pastry cutter and make the dough by hand.

- **Fresh grated cheese:** Use a block of real cheddar cheese that you freshly grate at home—it has more flavor than pre-shredded cheeses.

- **Don't skip chilling:** Without chilling, the crackers lose their shape in the oven.

- **Dry dough?** As you pat it into squares, if the dough feels a little dry, have a little extra cold water nearby to moisten your fingers if needed.

- **Easy to scale:** This is a very easy recipe to double or halve, depending how many mouths are hungry!
