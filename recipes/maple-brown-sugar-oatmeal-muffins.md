## Recipe Notes

- **Milk:** Anything from skim to whole milk will work. Non-dairy milks such as almond milk will also work.
- **Oil:** Any neutral oil, such as canola oil, will work.
- **Brown sugar:** If you prefer muffins that aren't as sweet, reduce the brown sugar to ⅓-½ cup.
- **Salt:** Or ¼ teaspoon table salt.
- **Pan preparation:** Use parchment cupcake liners or baking spray with flour.
- **Maple flavor:** For more maple flavor, add up to 1 teaspoon of maple flavoring with the wet ingredients.
- **Add-ins:** Feel free to stir in dried cranberries, blueberries, or chopped nuts.
- **Oven temperature:** If muffins brown too quickly, decrease temperature by 25°F.
