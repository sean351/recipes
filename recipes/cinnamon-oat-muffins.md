## Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 350°F. Grease a 12-count muffin pan or line with liners.

2. **Grind the oats:** Take 1½ cups of old fashion oats and place in food processor or blender. Grind mixture until it's finely ground and almost resembles flour. Set aside.

3. **Mix wet ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, mix applesauce, eggs, honey and vanilla until combined. Then, stir in milk. Mix to combine.

4. **Add dry ingredients:** Add in ground oats, remaining 1 cup of old fashion oats, baking soda & powder, salt and ground cinnamon. Mix to combined.

5. **Let sit:** Let mixture sit for 10 minutes. This will give the oats time to absorb the milk.

6. **Fill and top:** Spoon batter into prepared baking pan and top with old fashion oats and ground cinnamon.

7. **Bake:** Bake 20-25 minutes or until toothpick inserted comes out clean.

## Recipe Notes

- **Grinding oats:** You will need 2½ cups total oats. 1½ cups of that will need to be ground. This can be done with your food processor or blender.

- **Applesauce substitute:** You can also use 2-3 ripe mashed bananas instead of applesauce.

- **Milk:** I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, but regular dairy milk will work just fine.

- **Mixing:** Simply use a mixing bowl with a silicone spatula for mixing. No need to pull out your big electric mixer for these.

- **Important:** Don't forget to let the batter sit for 10 minutes after mixing is complete. This will give the oats a chance to soak up the milk.

- **Yield:** This recipe makes 18 muffins instead of the standard 12. You will need an additional 6-count muffin pan or bake in two separate batches.
